1. Ensure that a CPU workload is running.(using mpstat).

2. Confirm that the workload is CPU bound.

   a. Look for high CPU utilization system-wide or on a single CPU(using mpstat).

   b. Look for high run queue latency(using BCC runqlat).

3. Quentify CPU usage as percent utilization system-wide and then broken down by process, CPU mode, and CPU ID.

   a. For high system time, frequency-count system calls by process and call type.

4. Use a profiler to sample stack trace(e.g. flame graph).

5. Write cunstom tools to show more context.

6. Measure time in hardware interrupts.

7. Other tools.

8. Measure CPU instructions per cycle.
