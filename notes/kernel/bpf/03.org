* Performance Analysis

** Overview

** Performance Methodologies

*** Workload Characterization

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Suggested steps for performing workload characterization:

1. Who is causing the load(e.g., PID, process name)?

2. Why is the load called?

3. What is the load(IOPS, throughput, type)?

4. How is the load changing overtime?

*** Drill-Down Analysis

Decompose a metric and find the largest component.

*** USE Method 
1. Utilization
2. Saturation
3. Errors

*** Checklist

** Linux 60-seconds Analysis

*** uptime

*** dmesg | tail

*** vmstat 1

Prints 1-second summaries of the virtual memory statistics.

1. r: the number of process.
2. free: free memory, in Kbytes.
3. si and so: swap in and swap out.
4. us, sy, id, wa and st: user time, system time, idle, wait I/O and stolen time.

*** mpstat -P ALL 1
Prints  per-CPU time broken down into states.

*** pidstat 1
Prints CPU usage per process every second.

*** iostat -xz 1

*** free -m
Prints available memory in Mbytes.

*** sar -n DEV 1
Check interface throughput rxkB/s and txkB/s.

*** sar -n TCP, ETCP 1

*** top
